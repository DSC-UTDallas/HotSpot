### Problem We Want To Solve
UTD Students find it very hard to find seating/rooms/spots around campus. Most students spend so much time searching for seats rather than actually using them. In rush hour it gets more worse. The seating problem is not just faced in UTD but all over the US in colleges.

### The Solution To The Problem
Hotspot is a reservation based application that uses unique QR code on each table/room on campus to let the user reserve/view which table/rooms are booked in form a building map so they dont have to waste time searching for it. Users can only check into the table, but cannot reserve them since they are public but they can book rooms on campus.

##  MVP Features
This  version of the solution has the following features:

- Feature  #1
	- Scanning and checking in the tables and viewing them on a map.
- Feature #2
	- Booking for rooms for a partiuclar time.
